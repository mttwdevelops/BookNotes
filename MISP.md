MISP - Malware Information Sharing Platform

Link: https://www.misp-project.org/

Open source threat intelligence platform that collects, stores, and distributes **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**.

MISP works for:
- Malware reverse engineering
- Security investigations
- Intel analysis
- Risk analysis
- Law Enforcement
- Fraud analysis

Feeds contain indicators that can be imported into MISP to provide information about security events. They are managed by Site Admins

Taxonomies are a means of classifying information based on standard features or attributes. Here, they categorise events, indicators and threat actors based on tags that identify them.
