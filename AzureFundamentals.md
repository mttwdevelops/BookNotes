# Cloud concepts (25-30%)
Cloud services expand to IOT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Shared responsibility model means physical space, security and server maintenence blends with maintaining software and infrastructure.

Customers will always be responsible for the information and data stored in the cloud, devices connected to the cloud, and their accounts/identities.

The cloud provider will always be responsible for the physical datacenter and network along with the physical hosts.

### Cloud models
Private clouds are used by single entities. They tend to cost more.

Public clouds are controlled, built, and maintained by a 3rd party. They are publicly available, which is the main difference between public and private clouds.

Hybrid clouds use both public and private clouds connected to each other. This means owners can determine which cloud type to run their applications.

Multi clouds are becoming more common, which is where you use multiple **public** cloud providers at the same time.

### Consumption-based models
**Capital expenditure (CapEx)** is a one-time, up front expenditure/purchase for tangible resources. Buildings, parking lots, datacenters, or company vehicles are examples.

**Operation Expenditure (OpEx)** is spending money on services/products over time. Leasing company vehicles, signing up for cloud services, etc. are examples of OpEx.

### High Availability and Scalavility in the cloud
**Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** refers to service uptime for cloud models. They are measured in how high their availability is along with how scalable the service is under heavier demand.

**Vertical scaling** means if an app needs more processing power, you can add more CPUs or RAM to the VM, along with reducing when necessary.

**Horizontal scaling** means that your deployed resources could be scaled automatically or manually, specifically for containers or VMs. 

### Security and Governance in the cloud
If you want maximum control of sec., IaaS provides physical resources but lets you manage OS and installed software. PaaS or SaaS deployments take care of patches and maintenance.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Is the most flexible type of cloud service.

Cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, nectwork connection, and physical security. You are responsible for everything else.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Midpoint between IaaS and SaaS. 

PaaS is meant for providing complete development environments without maintaining all the development infrastructure. Business analytics solutions are PaaS, like SalesForce.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Renting out a fully developed application.

Email/messaging, business productivity, and financial tracking softwares are examples.
