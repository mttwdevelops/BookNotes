## Notes
A concept in the field of statistics is the idea of the "Central Limit Theorem," where as you take a sufficiently large random sample from the population with replacement, the distribution of the sample will approach a normal bell-curve shape.
This means that as you collect more data, your distribution has a noticable average. 

As this book takes perspectives and answers of a base set of questions from unique members of the Information Security (infosec) field, I noticed as a I kept reading that the answers that contributors would give would be similar to other answers given.

As a result, I have compiled a top-10 list of advice given from figures of the infosec community. These answers are by far the most common, yet I feel are the most important as one not only reads it but delves into the field and community of infosec.

1. Get a solid grasp of the basics of cybersecurity, especially computer networking.
2. Nothing is totally secure.
3. Least priviledge access is an easy, cheap way to minimize breaches.
4. Be nice to people, and always give back to the community.
5. Use a password manager.
6. Network. Get out there and talk to people at conferences, local makerspaces/hackerspaces, etc.
7. Not enough money is spent on training PEOPLE. This is a major reason why people job-hop.
8. Old or simple social engineering techniques can triumph even the toughest security systems.
9. Not everything has to be online, like your appliances.
10. Proper/realistic threat modeling is cheaper and better than shiny products.
